## Automated Version Control

We'll start by exploring how version control can be used to keep track of what one person did and when. Even if you aren't collaborating with other people, automated version control is much better than this situation:

We've all been in this situation before: it seems ridiculous to have multiple nearly-identical versions of the same document. Some word processors let us deal with this a little better, such as Microsoft Word's [Track Changes](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Track-changes-in-Word-197ba630-0f5f-4a8e-9a77-3712475e806a), Google Docs' [version history](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843?hl=en), or LibreOffice's [Recording and Displaying Changes](https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Recording_and_Displaying_Changes).

Version control systems start with a base version of the document and then save just the changes you made at each step of the way. You can think of it as a tape: if you rewind the tape and start at the base document, then you can play back each change and end up with your latest version.

Once you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you can then think about "playing back" different sets of changes onto the base document and getting different versions of the document. For example, two users can make independent sets of changes based on the same document.

Unless there are conflicts, you can even play two sets of changes onto the same base document.

A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us and helps us version and merge our files. It allows you to decide which changes make up the next version, called a commit and keeps useful metadata about them. The complete history of commits for a particular project and their metadata make up a repository. Repositories can be kept in sync across different computers facilitating collaboration among different people.

> **The Long History of Version Control Systems**
>
> Automated version control systems are nothing new. Tools like RCS, CVS, or Subversion have been around since the early 1980s and are used by many large companies. However, many of these are now becoming considered as legacy systems due to various limitations in their capabilities. In particular, the more modern systems, such as Git and [Mercurial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/hg-novice/) are *distributed*, meaning that they do not need a centralized server to host the repository. These modern systems also include powerful merging tools that make it possible for multiple authors to work within the same files concurrently.


## How can version control help me make my work more open?

Free sharing of information might be the ideal in science, but the reality is often more complicated. Normal practice today looks something like this:

*   A scientist collects some data and stores it on a machine that is occasionally backed up by her department.
*   She then writes or modifies a few small programs (which also reside on her machine) to analyze that data.
*   Once she has some results, she writes them up and submits her paper. She might include her data—a growing number of journals require this—but she probably doesn't include her code.
*   Time passes.
*   The journal sends her reviews written anonymously by a handful of other people in her field. She revises her paper to satisfy them, during which time she might also modify the scripts she wrote earlier, and resubmits.
*   More time passes.
*   The paper is eventually published. It might include a link to an online copy of her data, but the paper itself will be behind a paywall: only people who have personal or institutional access will be able to read it.

For a growing number of scientists, though, the process looks like this:

*   The data that the scientist collects is stored in an open access repository like [figshare](http://figshare.com/) or [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org), possibly as soon as it's collected, and given its own [Digital Object Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) (DOI). Or the data was already published and is stored in [Dryad](http://datadryad.org/).
*   The scientist creates a new repository on GitHub to hold her work.
*   As she does her analysis, she pushes changes to her scripts (and possibly some output files) to that repository. She also uses the repository for her paper; that repository is then the hub for collaboration with her colleagues.
*   When she's happy with the state of her paper, she posts a version to [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/) or some other preprint server to invite feedback from peers.
*   Based on that feedback, she may post several revisions before finally submitting her paper to a journal.
*   The published paper includes links to her preprint and to her code and data repositories, which  makes it much easier for other scientists to use her work as starting point for their own research.

This open model accelerates discovery: the more open work is, [the more widely it is cited and re-used](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0000308). However, people who want to work this way need to make some decisions about what exactly "open" means and how to do it. You can find more on the different aspects of Open Science in [this book](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8).

This is one of the (many) reasons we teach version control. When used diligently, it answers the "how" question by acting as a shareable electronic lab notebook for computational work:

*   The conceptual stages of your work are documented, including who did what and when. Every step is stamped with an identifier (the commit ID) that is for most intents and purposes unique.
*   You can tie documentation of rationale, ideas, and other intellectual work directly to the changes that spring from them.
*   You can refer to what you used in your research to obtain your computational results in a way that is unique and recoverable.
*   With a distributed version control system such as Git, the version control repository is easy to archive for perpetuity, and contains the entire history.
