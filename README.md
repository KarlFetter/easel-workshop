# Reproducible analysis and Research Transparency

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/reproducible-analysis-workshop/badge/?version=latest)](http://reproducible-analysis-workshop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Transparency, open sharing, and reproducibility are core values of science, but not always part of daily practice. This workshop will provide an overview of current status in reproducible analysis in order to provide transparency in research. The workshop will cover methodological topics (such as the use of the Open Science Framework and reporting guidelines) as well as software tools (such as Git, Docker, R Markdown/knitr and Jupyter). Going beyond simple listing and presentations, the workshop will focus on hands-on skill building, with exercises and tutorials covering most of the software aspects. Specifically, a draft agenda of the workshop is the following:
- Introduction / Current state in Reproducible analysis and Research Transparency
- Overview of the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines (Center for Open Science)
- Reproducibility in practice: looking versioning and standardization

- Tutorial / hands-on exercises on Git
- Tutorial / hands-on exercises on Docker
- Tutorial / hands-on exercises on Jupyter

- Tutorial / hands-on exercises on R and R Markdown/knitr
