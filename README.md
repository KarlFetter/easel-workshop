# Reproducible analysis and Research Transparency

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/reproducible-analysis-workshop/badge/?version=latest)](http://reproducible-analysis-workshop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Transparency, open sharing, and reproducibility are core values of science, but not always part of daily practice. This workshop will provide an overview of current status in reproducible analysis in order to provide transparency in research. The workshop will cover methodological topics (such as the use of the Open Science Framework and reporting guidelines) as well as software tools (such as `Git`, `Docker`, `RMarkdown` / `knitr` and `Jupyter`). Going beyond simple listing and presentations, the workshop will focus on hands-on skill building, with exercises and tutorials covering most of the software aspects. Specifically, a draft agenda of the workshop is the following:

- _09:00 - 09:15_ **Introduction** (_Setup_)


- _09:15 - 10:00_ **Reproducible Research** (_Current state in Reproducible analysis and Research Transparency_)
- _10:00 - 10:45_ **Transparent Research** (_Overview of the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines (Center for Open Science)_)



- _10:45 - 11:00_ _**Coffee break**_



- _11:00 - 11:45_ **Reproducibility in practice** (_Looking at versioning and standardization_)
- _11:45 - 12:30_ **Jupyter** (_Using the `Jupyter` environment; languages supported and live documents._)

- _14:15 - 15:00_ **R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis** (_`RMarkdown` in RStudio and `knitr`_)



- _15:00 - 15:15_ _**Coffee break**_
