# Reproducible analysis and Research Transparency

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/reproducible-analysis-workshop/badge/?version=latest)](http://reproducible-analysis-workshop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This workshop was part of the [Open Science Tools, Data & Technologies for Efficient Ecological & Evolutionary Research Symposium](https://nioo.knaw.nl/en/open-science-tools), organized by NIOO-KNAW and DANS-KNAW on 7 & 8 December 2017 at the [Amsterdam Science Park](https://www.amsterdamsciencepark.nl/about-amsterdam-science-park/profile/).

Transparency, open sharing, and reproducibility are core values of science, but not always part of daily practice. This workshop provided an overview of current status in reproducible analysis in order to provide transparency in research. The workshop covered methodological topics (such as the use of the Open Science Framework and reporting guidelines) as well as software tools (such as `Git`, `Docker`, `RMarkdown` / `knitr` and `Jupyter`). Going beyond simple listing and presentations, the workshop focused on hands-on skill building, with exercises and tutorials covering most of the software aspects. Specifically, the agenda of the workshop was the following:

- _08:40 - 09:00_ _**Coffee break**_

- _09:00 - 09:20_ **Introduction** (_Setup_)


- _09:20 - 10:10_ **Reproducible Research** (_Current state in Reproducible analysis and Research Transparency_)
- _10:10 - 11:00_ **Transparent Research** (_Overview of the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines (Center for Open Science)_)



- _11:00 - 11:30_ _**Coffee break**_



- _11:30 - 12:15_ **Reproducibility in practice** (_Looking at versioning and standardization_)
- _12:15 - 13:00_ **Jupyter** (_Using the `Jupyter` environment; languages supported and live documents._)



- _13:00 - 14:00_ _**Lunch break**_



- _14:00 - 14:45_ **R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis** (_Writing modular code and best practices for using R for data analysis within Jupyter._)
- _14:45 - 15:30_ **R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis** (_`RMarkdown` in RStudio and `knitr`_)



- _15:30 - 16:00_ _**Coffee break**_



- _16:00 - 16:45_ **Versioning with Git** (_Version control. Open collaborative coding._)
- _16:45 - 17:30_ **Docker** (_Putting it all together._)



- _17:30 - 18:00_ **Closing** (_Discussion_)


_Venue_

The workshop will take place at the Amsterdam Science Park, building CWI, Room Euler A.
