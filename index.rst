Reproducible analysis and Research Transparency
=================================================

This workshop was part of the `Open Science Tools, Data & Technologies for Efficient Ecological & Evolutionary Research Symposium <https://nioo.knaw.nl/en/open-science-tools>`_, organized by NIOO-KNAW and DANS-KNAW on 7 & 8 December 2017 at the `Amsterdam Science Park <https://www.amsterdamsciencepark.nl/about-amsterdam-science-park/profile/>`_.

Transparency, open sharing, and reproducibility are core values of science, but not always part of daily practice. This workshop provided an overview of current status in reproducible analysis in order to provide transparency in research. The workshop covered methodological topics (such as the use of the Open Science Framework and reporting guidelines) as well as software tools (such as ``Git``, ``Docker``, ``RMarkdown`` / ``knitr`` and ``Jupyter``). Going beyond simple listing and presentations, the workshop focused on hands-on skill building, with exercises and tutorials covering most of the software aspects. Specifically, the agenda of the workshop was the following:
