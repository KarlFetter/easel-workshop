# Docker and Reproducibility

As computational work becomes more and more integral to many aspects of scientific research, computational reproducibility has become an issue of increasing importance to computer systems researchers and domain scientists alike. Though computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious challenge.

Studies focusing on code that has been made available with scientific publications regularly find the same common issues that pose substantial barriers to reproducing the original results or building on that code:

1. "Dependency Hell"
2. Imprecise documentation
3. Code rot
4. Barriers to adoption and reuse in existing solutions

## Docker

Docker is an open source project that builds on many long familiar technologies from operating systems research: LXC containers, virtualization of the OS, and a hash-based or git-like versioning and differencing system, among others.

1. Docker images: resolving "Dependency Hell"
2. Dockerfiles: Resolving imprecise documentation
3. Tackling code-rot with image versions
4. Barriers to adoption and re-use

## Jupyter, Docker, MyBinder

mybinder r dockerfile
https://github.com/binder-examples/dockerfile-r
https://github.com/binder-examples/dockerfile-r/blob/master/Dockerfile
https://github.com/binder-examples/dockerfile-rstudio

Binder allows you to create custom computing environments that can be shared and used by many remote users.

Binder makes it simple to generate reproducible computing environments from a GitHub repository. Binder uses the BinderHub technology to generate a Docker image from this repository. The image will have all the components that you specify along with the Jupyter Notebooks inside. You will be able to share a URL with users that can immediately begin interacting with this environment via the cloud.

If you or another Binder user clicks on a Binder link, the mybinder.org deployment will run the linked repository. While running, you are guaranteed to have at least 1G of RAM. There is an upper-limit of 4GB (if you use more than 4GB your kernel will be restarted).
